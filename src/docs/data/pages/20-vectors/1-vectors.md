# Vectors

There are the following types of vectors:
**Vector2** for a 2D vector, **Vector3** for a 3D vector, and **Vector** for the general case.

```js
import { Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Vector } from 'mz-math';

const v2: Vector2 = [1, 2];
const v3: Vector3 = [1, 2, 3];
const v4: Vector4 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const v5: Vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const v6: Vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
```
